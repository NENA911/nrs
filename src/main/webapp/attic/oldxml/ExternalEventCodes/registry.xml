	<description>CAP messages are used for events sent to, and within an ESInet.  CAP messages have an &lt;event code&gt; tag.  For use within ESInets, elements sending or receiving CAP messages must have a common understanding of what kind of an event is being sent, primarily to use in routing decisions.</description>
	<note>A new entry to ExternalEventCode requires an explanation of the use of the new code how it is differentiated from other values in the registry.
        Expert Review is required to add a new entry into the registry.  The Expert should consider whether the new proposed code is needed to differentiate a CAP message with that code from existing values.  A proliferation of codes is not helpful because the routing mechanisms may get cumbersome.  On the other hand, there are many possible sources of alerts, which may well need to be routed differentially, and thus the barrier for a new code should be modest.
